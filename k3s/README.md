# Automated build of HA k3s Cluster with `kube-vip` and MetalLB

![Fully Automated K3S etcd High Availability Install]

This playbook will build an HA Kubernetes cluster with `k3s`, `kube-vip` and MetalLB via `ansible`.


## 📖 k3s Ansible Playbook

Build a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible with k3s. The goal is easily install a HA Kubernetes cluster on machines running:

on processor architecture:

- [X] x64
- [X] arm64
- [X] armhf

- [x] Debian (tested on version 11)
- [x] Ubuntu (tested on version 22.04)
- [x] Rocky (tested on version 9)


## ✅ System requirements

- Control Node (the machine you are running `ansible` commands) must have Ansible 2.11+ If you need a quick primer on Ansible [you can check out my docs and setting up Ansible]

- You will also need to install collections that this playbook uses by running `ansible-galaxy collection install -r ./collections/requirements.yml` (important❗)

- [`netaddr` package](https://pypi.org/project/netaddr/) must be available to Ansible. If you have installed Ansible via apt, this is already taken care of. If you have installed Ansible via `pip`, make sure to install `netaddr` into the respective virtual environment.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🍴 Preparation

First create a new directory based on the `sample` directory within the `inventory` directory:

```bash
cp -R inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster
```

Second, edit `inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini` to match the system information gathered above

For example:

```ini
[master]
172.16.3.11
172.16.3.12
172.16.3.13

[node]
172.16.3.14
172.16.3.15
172.16.3.16

[k3s_cluster:children]
master
node
```

If multiple hosts are in the master group, the playbook will automatically set up k3s in [HA mode with etcd](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha-embedded/).

Finally, copy `ansible.example.cfg` to `ansible.cfg` and adapt the inventory path to match the files that you just created.

This requires at least k3s version `1.19.1` however the version is configurable by using the `k3s_version` variable.

If needed, you can also edit `inventory/my-cluster/group_vars/all.yml` to match your environment.

### ☸️ Create Cluster

Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini
```

After deployment control plane will be accessible via virtual ip-address which is defined in inventory/group_vars/all.yml as `apiserver_endpoint`

### 🔥 Remove k3s cluster

```bash
ansible-playbook reset.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini
```
>You should also reboot these nodes due to the VIP not being destroyed

```bash
ansible-playbook reboot.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini
```


## ⚙️ Kube Config

To copy your `kube config` locally so that you can access your **Kubernetes** cluster run:

```bash
scp debian@master_ip:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
```

### 🔨 Testing your cluster


### Testing the playbook using molecule

This playbook includes a [molecule](https://molecule.rtfd.io/)-based test setup.
It is run automatically in CI, but you can also run the tests locally.
This might be helpful for quick feedback in a few cases.
You can find more information about it [here](molecule/README.md).

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repo uses `pre-commit` and `pre-commit-hooks` to lint and fix common style and syntax errors.  Be sure to install python packages and then run `pre-commit install`.  For more information, see [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
